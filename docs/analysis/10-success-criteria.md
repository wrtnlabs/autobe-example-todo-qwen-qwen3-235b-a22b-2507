# Success Criteria for Minimal Todo Application (minimalTodo)

## Core Feature Validation

### Task Management Completeness
THE system SHALL support the complete lifecycle of personal tasks through creation, viewing, updating, and deletion, ensuring users can manage their responsibilities end-to-end.

WHEN a user creates a new task, THE system SHALL confirm successful creation and display the task in their list immediately, providing immediate feedback on the action.

WHEN a user marks a task as complete, THE system SHALL update the task status visibly in the list without requiring manual refresh, maintaining workflow continuity.

WHEN a user modifies task details, THE system SHALL save changes instantly and reflect updates in the task list, preventing data loss and ensuring accuracy.

WHEN a user deletes a task, THE system SHALL remove it from view immediately and confirm the action, providing confidence in their management decisions.

### Minimum Functionality Verification
THE system SHALL implement only the essential features required for basic task management, excluding advanced functionality that would complicate the user experience.

WHERE advanced features like task sharing, team collaboration, or deadline reminders could be implemented, THE system SHALL omit these capabilities to maintain minimal scope and prevent feature bloat.

THE system SHALL provide a single, unified interface for all task operations, eliminating navigation complexity and focusing exclusively on core functionality.

THE interface SHALL present only controls necessary for task creation, completion, editing, and deletion, removing any secondary functions that don't directly support the minimal use case.

## User Satisfaction Metrics

### Usability Effectiveness
THE application SHALL enable users to create and manage tasks successfully within 60 seconds of first interaction, demonstrating immediate usability.

WHEN a new user accesses the application, THE system SHALL present an intuitive interface that requires no training or instruction to begin managing tasks, accommodating users with limited technical experience.

THE task creation process SHALL require no more than three distinct actions (e.g., click, type, confirm), minimizing interaction complexity for the target audience.

IF a user completes ten consecutive task operations (create, update, or delete) without errors, THEN THE system SHALL consider the user experience sufficiently intuitive for the minimal use case.

### User Engagement Indicators
THE system SHALL encourage consistent task management by providing a satisfying interaction experience that motivates regular use.

WHILE a user is actively managing tasks, THE system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for all actions, reinforcing their sense of control and accomplishment.

THE system SHALL maintain task data persistence across sessions, allowing users to return and find their tasks exactly as left, establishing reliability.

IF a user returns to the application three times within a seven-day period, THEN THE system SHALL consider the solution sticky enough to address their ongoing organizational needs.

## Business Value Indicators

### Solution Relevance
THE minimalTodo application SHALL solve the specific problem of personal task tracking for individuals who need a straightforward, no-frills solution.

THE system SHALL differentiate itself from feature-rich competitors by specializing in simplicity and ease of use, targeting users overwhelmed by complex productivity tools.

WHEN compared to alternative task management solutions, THE minimalTodo application SHALL load and respond noticeably faster due to its minimal codebase and focused functionality.

THE application SHALL have a conversion rate of at least 40% from first visit to registered user, indicating strong alignment between user expectations and delivered functionality.

### Market Position Validation
THE system SHALL occupy a distinct position in the task management market as the simplest viable solution, avoiding direct competition with comprehensive productivity suites.

WHERE users express frustration with complex interfaces in other tools, THE minimalTodo application SHALL address this pain point specifically with its streamlined design philosophy.

THE solution SHALL receive positive feedback from at least 80% of beta testers regarding its ease of use, confirming the effectiveness of the minimal approach.

IF market analysis shows demand for simplified alternatives to existing task managers, THEN THE system SHALL consider this validation of its core business premise.

## Adoption Success Factors

### User Acquisition Efficiency
THE system SHALL require minimal marketing effort to achieve initial adoption due to its clear value proposition of simplicity.

THE registration process SHALL convert at least 50% of visitors who attempt to create an account, indicating the sign-up process presents no significant barriers.

WHEN a user completes registration, THE system SHALL guide them immediately to task creation without intermediate steps, reducing time-to-value.

THE system SHALL achieve 1,000 active users within the first 90 days of launch, demonstrating market acceptance of the minimal approach.

### User Retention Performance
THE system SHALL retain at least 30% of registered users after 30 days, indicating the solution continues to meet their needs beyond initial interest.

WHILE a user maintains an active account, THE system SHALL support an average of 15 task operations per week, demonstrating ongoing engagement with the core functionality.

IF user activity shows consistent weekly task management patterns, THEN THE system SHALL consider this evidence of habit formation and reliable utility.

THE application SHALL have a churn rate below 5% per month after the first 30 days, indicating sustained value delivery to users.

## Quality Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Integrity
THE system SHALL correctly process 99.9% of valid user actions without errors, ensuring reliability in core task management operations.

WHEN a user performs standard task operations, THE system SHALL complete the requested action within 2 seconds under normal conditions, providing a responsive experience.

IF a system error occurs during task management, THEN THE system SHALL recover user data to its last known good state and notify the user of the issue, minimizing data loss.

THE system SHALL validate user inputs according to business rules and provide specific error messages for invalid data, preventing incorrect task entries.

### User Trust Establishment
THE system SHALL protect user task data from unauthorized access through proper authentication and data isolation, maintaining privacy.

WHILE a user is logged in, THE session SHALL remain active for 30 days of inactivity before requiring re-authentication, balancing convenience and security.

THE system SHALL provide users the ability to export their entire task history on demand, giving them control over their data and building trust.

IF a user requests account deletion, THEN THE system SHALL remove all personal data and tasks completely within 7 days, complying with data privacy expectations.

## Future Expansion Readiness

### Business Scalability Assessment
THE system SHALL demonstrate the viability of the minimal product philosophy, providing a foundation for potential strategic expansion if market validation occurs.

WHERE user feedback indicates demand for specific additional features, THE system SHALL evaluate these requests against the core minimal philosophy before considering implementation.

THE business model SHALL break even on operational costs within 180 days of launch, proving economic sustainability of the minimal approach.

IF analytics show at least 60% of users consistently use only the core features without seeking additional functionality, THEN THE system SHALL confirm the success of its minimal design philosophy.
