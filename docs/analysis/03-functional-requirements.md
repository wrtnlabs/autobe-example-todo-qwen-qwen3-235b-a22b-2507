# Functional Requirements Document for Minimal Todo Application

## Task Management Requirements

The minimalTodo application must support core task management functionality that allows users to create, organize, and complete personal tasks with minimal complexity. This section defines all business-level functional requirements in natural language, using EARS format where applicable, while maintaining strict separation from technical implementation details.

### Task Creation Functionality
WHEN a user submits a new task, THE system SHALL create a task record with title and default status of incomplete.

THE task title SHALL be limited to a maximum of 100 characters to ensure conciseness and display compatibility across devices.

IF a user attempts to create a task with an empty title, THEN THE system SHALL prevent creation and display a specific error message: "Task title is required."

THE system SHALL automatically assign a unique identifier to each new task for internal tracking purposes, invisible to the user.

### Task Status Management
WHEN a user marks a task as complete, THE system SHALL update the task status to complete and record the completion timestamp.

THE system SHALL provide a visual distinction between completed and incomplete tasks in all task listings.

WHEN a user marks a completed task as incomplete, THE system SHALL reset the completion status and remove the completion timestamp.

THE task status SHALL only have two values: "incomplete" (default) and "complete", maintaining simplicity in the minimal implementation.

### Task Modification Capabilities
WHEN a user requests to edit a task, THE system SHALL allow modification of the task title and description fields.

WHEN a user updates a task title, THE system SHALL validate that the new title does not exceed 100 characters before accepting the change.

THE system SHALL preserve the original creation timestamp when modifying task details, as this represents the business record of when the task was conceived.

IF a user attempts to save changes with an empty title, THEN THE system SHALL prevent the update and display the same validation message as during creation.

### Task Deletion Process
WHEN a user requests to delete a task, THE system SHALL permanently remove the task from their accessible task list.

THE system SHALL require explicit user confirmation before executing task deletion to prevent accidental loss of task information.

IF a user confirms deletion, THEN THE system SHALL remove the task immediately and confirm completion of the operation.

THE system SHALL NOT provide a task recovery or undo function for deleted tasks, consistent with the minimal feature set philosophy.

## User Authentication Requirements

The authentication system shall provide secure access to individual user task lists while maintaining simplicity appropriate for a minimal Todo application.

### Authentication Process Requirements
WHEN a user attempts to access the application, THE system SHALL verify their authentication status before allowing task management operations.

WHEN a user submits login credentials, THE system SHALL validate these against stored authentication data and respond within 2 seconds for optimal user experience.

THE system SHALL maintain user sessions for 30 days of inactivity before requiring re-authentication, balancing convenience and security for the target user.

THE password complexity SHALL require a minimum of 8 characters with at least one letter and one number to ensure basic security standards.

### User Registration Process
WHEN a new user creates an account, THE system SHALL capture email and password information for authentication purposes.

THE system SHALL verify email format validity before accepting registration to maintain data quality.

THE system SHALL check for email uniqueness before creating a new account to prevent duplicate user identities.

IF a registration attempt uses an email that already exists, THEN THE system SHALL prevent account creation and display: "An account with this email already exists."

WHEN an account is successfully created, THE system SHALL automatically authenticate the user and redirect to their task dashboard.

### Password Recovery
WHEN a user requests password recovery, THE system SHALL send a reset link to their registered email address.

THE password reset link SHALL expire after 24 hours to maintain security standards.

WHEN a user accesses the reset link, THE system SHALL allow them to set a new password that meets the established complexity requirements.

IF a user attempts to use an expired reset link, THEN THE system SHALL display: "Reset link has expired. Please request a new password reset."

## Data Management Requirements

The data persistence system shall ensure user tasks are reliably stored and accessible across sessions while protecting user privacy and isolation.

### Data Integrity
THE system SHALL maintain consistency between user actions and stored task data, ensuring all modifications are accurately reflected in the persistent store.

WHEN a user performs a task operation, THE system SHALL confirm completion to the user before considering the operation final.

THE system SHALL implement transactional integrity so that partial operations do not result in corrupted or inconsistent data states.

### Data Isolation
THE system SHALL ensure each user can only access and modify their own tasks, preventing unauthorized access to other users' task lists.

WHEN processing any task request, THE system SHALL verify the requesting user has proper authorization for the targeted task resource.

THE system SHALL not provide any functionality for sharing tasks between users, consistent with the minimal implementation scope.

### Data Backup and Recovery
THE system SHALL automatically backup user task data daily to protect against data loss from system failures.

WHEN a system failure occurs, THE system SHALL be able to restore user data from the most recent backup with minimal data loss.

THE system SHALL maintain backup copies for 30 days to allow recovery from various failure scenarios.


## Validation Rules

The validation system shall ensure data quality and integrity by enforcing business rules on user inputs and system operations.

### Input Validation Requirements
THE task title SHALL only accept alphanumeric characters, spaces, and basic punctuation (period, comma, exclamation mark, question mark) to prevent display and processing issues.

WHEN a user enters a task title with invalid characters, THE system SHALL strip these characters and notify the user of the cleanup.

THE system SHALL validate all user inputs against defined business rules before processing to prevent corruption of data integrity.

### Business Rule Validation
THE system SHALL validate that all task operations comply with the business rules defined in this document before execution.

WHEN a user attempts to perform an unauthorized operation, THE system SHALL deny the request and provide a specific message explaining why the action cannot be completed.

THE system SHALL log all validation failures for administrative review while maintaining user privacy in the logs.

## Business Logic Constraints

The application shall enforce specific business rules that define the behavior and constraints of the task management system.

### Minimum Viable Feature Set
THE system SHALL include only the following core features to maintain minimal complexity:
- User authentication (login, registration, password recovery)
- Task creation with title
- Task status management (incomplete/complete)
- Task modification (title and description editing)
- Task deletion with confirmation
- Task list display with status visualization

WHERE additional features such as due dates, categories, priority levels, or reminders could be implemented, THE system SHALL exclude these to maintain focus on the minimal viable product.

### User Experience Simplicity
THE system SHALL present a single, unified interface for all task management functions to minimize cognitive load on users.

THE interface SHALL not include any configuration options or settings screens that could complicate the user experience.

WHEN users complete common tasks like marking items as done, THE system SHALL require the minimum number of interactions possible to accomplish the goal.

### Privacy and Security Constraints
THE system SHALL not retain deleted task data beyond 7 days except in backup systems required for disaster recovery.

THE system SHALL encrypt user passwords using industry-standard hashing algorithms before storage to protect user credentials.

THE system SHALL log authentication events (successful and failed attempts) for security monitoring while preserving user privacy in the log content.

### Performance Constraints
THE system SHALL respond to user actions within 2 seconds under normal operating conditions to maintain a responsive user experience.

WHEN displaying the task list, THE system SHALL load and render all tasks within 3 seconds even with a substantial number of active tasks.

THE system SHALL optimize data retrieval to minimize bandwidth usage, particularly important for mobile users.

## EARS Format Implementation

All applicable requirements in this document use the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format to ensure clarity, testability, and unambiguous interpretation by development teams.

The implemented EARS patterns include:

1. **Event-driven**: "WHEN [trigger], THE system SHALL [function]"
   - Used for user-initiated actions and system responses

2. **Unwanted Behavior**: "IF [condition], THEN THE system SHALL [function]"
   - Used for error handling and exceptional cases

3. **Ubiquitous**: "THE system SHALL [function]"
   - Used for always-active requirements and system constants

This consistent application of EARS format transforms vague statements into specific, measurable, and testable business requirements that development teams can implement with confidence.

> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**. All technical implementations (architecture, APIs, database design, etc.) are at the discretion of the development team.*
