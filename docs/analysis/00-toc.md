# Minimal Todo Application Documentation Roadmap

This documentation suite provides comprehensive business requirements for backend developers to implement a minimal Todo list application. The documentation focuses exclusively on **what** the system should do from a business perspective, with all technical implementation decisions reserved for the development team.

## 1. Service Overview Documentation
Understanding the fundamental business context and scope of the minimal Todo application is essential before diving into specific requirements. This section establishes why this minimal implementation delivers sufficient value without unnecessary complexity.

- [Core Purpose and Boundaries](01-service-overview.md): Complete explanation of the business problem statement, target user profile, and clearly defined project boundaries that maintain minimal viable product focus
- [Business Value Proposition](01-service-overview.md#core-value-proposition): Specific explanation of what makes this minimal Todo solution valuable compared to existing alternatives
- [Explicitly Out-of-Scope Features](01-service-overview.md#out-of-scope-elements): Comprehensive list of common Todo features deliberately excluded from this minimal implementation to maintain focus

## 2. Business Model Documentation
This section defines the business justification and operational framework for the minimal Todo application, even for what might appear to be a simple utility. Understanding the business context ensures developers make appropriate trade-offs during implementation.

- [Why This Minimal Todo Service Exists](02-business-model.md#why-this-service-exists): Detailed market need analysis including specific problems solved by this minimal implementation
- [Success Metrics for Minimal Implementation](02-business-model.md#success-metrics): Measurable indicators demonstrating whether the minimal version delivers sufficient business value
- [Sustainability Plan](02-business-model.md#sustainability-plan): Explanation of how even a minimal Todo application creates value worthy of development resources

## 3. Functional Requirements Documentation
Comprehensive business requirements written in clear, natural language using EARS format, specifying exactly what the system must do in measurable, unambiguous terms. These requirements focus exclusively on user value, not technical implementation.

### Task Management Requirements
- [Task Creation Requirements](03-functional-requirements.md#task-management-requirements): 
  - WHEN a user submits a new task, THE system SHALL create it with title and default incomplete status
  - THE task title SHALL be limited to 100 characters
  - IF a task title exceeds limitations, THEN THE system SHALL reject it with specific validation message

### User Authentication Requirements
- [Authentication Process Requirements](03-functional-requirements.md#user-authentication-requirements):
  - WHEN a user enters credentials, THE system SHALL validate and respond within 2 seconds
  - THE password complexity SHALL require minimum 8 characters with letters and numbers
  - WHERE two-factor authentication is enabled, THE system SHALL require verification code

### Validation Rules
- [Input Validation Requirements](03-functional-requirements.md#validation-rules):
  - THE task title SHALL contain only alphanumeric characters and basic punctuation
  - WHEN validating input, THE system SHALL provide specific, actionable error messages
  - WHILE entering task details, THE system SHALL prevent submission of empty titles

## 4. User Experience Documentation
Understanding how users interact with the system helps developers implement business logic that aligns with user expectations and goals, even in a minimal implementation.

- [Primary User Personas](04-user-stories.md#primary-user-personas): Typical user profiles who would benefit from this minimal Todo implementation
- [Core Task Lifecycle Journey](04-user-stories.md#task-lifecycle-journey): Complete user journey from task creation through completion in business terms
- [Authentication Flow Scenarios](05-user-flow.md#authentication-flow): Step-by-step business process description of user login and session management
- [Task Management Interaction Patterns](05-user-flow.md#task-creation-flow): Business-focused sequence of actions for creating, updating, and completing tasks

## 5. Operational Requirements Documentation
Critical non-functional business requirements that define how the system should behave under various conditions to maintain user trust and satisfaction.

### Error Handling Specifications
- [Input Validation Failures](06-error-handling.md#input-validation-failures): Business rules for communicating validation errors to users
- [System Error Recovery](06-error-handling.md#user-recovery-processes): Required user-facing recovery processes for system failures

### Performance Expectations
- [User Experience Responsiveness](07-performance.md#user-experience-expectations): 
  - WHEN a user creates a task, THE system SHALL confirm completion instantly
  - WHILE managing tasks, THE system SHALL maintain responsiveness below 1 second
  - THE application SHALL feel immediate during all core task operations

### Security Requirements
- [Data Protection Standards](08-security.md#data-protection-requirements): Business-focused user data protection expectations
- [Authentication Security](08-security.md#authentication-security-standards): Required security expectations for user verification processes

### Reference Materials
- [Business Terminology Glossary](09-glossary.md): Precise definitions of all business terms used throughout requirements documentation
- [Measurable Success Criteria](10-success-criteria.md): Specific pass/fail criteria that determine business success of the minimal implementation

> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**. All technical implementations (architecture, APIs, database design, etc.) are at the discretion of the development team.*
