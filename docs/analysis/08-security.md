# Security Requirements for Minimal Todo Application (minimalTodo)

## Data Protection Requirements

### Task Data Confidentiality
WHEN a user creates a task, THE system SHALL store it securely and ensure only the authenticated user can access their own tasks, preventing data leakage between users.

WHILE the system processes user task data, THE system SHALL ensure no sensitive information is exposed in logs, error messages, or API responses.

THE system SHALL isolate each user's task data from other users through proper access controls, ensuring one user cannot view or modify another user's tasks even through system misconfiguration.

WHERE system operations involve task data, THE system SHALL implement proper authorization checks before allowing any data access or modification.

### Data Integrity Protection
WHEN a user updates a task, THE system SHALL ensure the modification is applied correctly without data corruption or loss, maintaining accuracy of user information.

THE task modification timestamp SHALL reflect the exact time of change for business accountability purposes, preventing timestamp manipulation.

WHILE handling concurrent task modifications, THE system SHALL prevent data conflicts and ensure the most recent valid change is preserved.

IF system processing fails during data operations, THEN THE system SHALL revert to previous valid state to maintain data consistency.

## Authentication Security Standards

### Credential Protection
THE user password SHALL be stored using industry-standard hashing algorithms with appropriate salt values, ensuring passwords cannot be recovered if database is compromised.

WHEN a user creates an account, THE system SHALL enforce minimum password complexity requirements including at least 8 characters with a mix of letters and numbers.

THE system SHALL never store or transmit passwords in plaintext format at any stage of processing or storage.

WHILE handling authentication requests, THE system SHALL implement proper timing to prevent timing attacks that could reveal valid usernames.

### Session Management Security
THE user session SHALL expire automatically after 30 minutes of inactivity to mitigate session hijacking risks, balancing security with user convenience.

WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL immediately invalidate the session token and prevent further use of that token for authentication.

THE session token SHALL be transmitted securely using appropriate mechanisms to prevent interception, though specific technical implementation is developer discretion.

IF a user attempts multiple failed logins (5 consecutive failures), THEN THE system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 15 minutes to prevent brute force attacks.

### Authentication Error Handling
WHEN an authentication attempt fails, THE system SHALL provide generic error messages that don't reveal whether the username or password was incorrect, preventing user enumeration.

THE system SHALL log authentication failures for security monitoring purposes while protecting the privacy of legitimate users.

IF repeated failed authentication attempts occur from the same source, THE system SHALL implement progressive rate limiting to prevent automated attacks.

WHILE handling account lockout scenarios, THE system SHALL clearly communicate the lockout duration to legitimate users without revealing specifics to potential attackers.

## Compliance Considerations

### Minimal Data Collection
THE system SHALL collect only the minimum personal data necessary for functionality (email and password), reducing data protection obligations and security risks.

WHERE additional information could be collected, THE system SHALL omit it to maintain minimal security exposure, consistent with GDPR and similar privacy principles.

THE password recovery process SHALL not require security questions or additional personal information beyond verification code sent to registered email.

IF a user requests data export or deletion, THE system SHALL provide mechanisms to fulfill these requests within business requirements timeframe.

### User Privacy Rights
WHEN a user requests account deletion, THE system SHALL permanently remove all personal data and tasks within 7 days, respecting data subject rights.

THE user SHALL have the ability to view and export their complete task history in a standard format upon request, supporting data portability requirements.

IF a security breach occurs involving user data, THE system SHALL support mechanisms for prompt notification in compliance with relevant regulations.

THE system SHALL maintain an audit trail of significant account actions (creation, deletion, password changes) for business accountability purposes.

## User Data Privacy Rules

### Email Verification
WHEN a user registers, THE system SHALL send a verification email containing a time-limited verification code to confirm email ownership.

THE email verification link SHALL expire after 24 hours to prevent misuse of stale verification tokens.

IF a user requests a new verification email, THE system SHALL invalidate previous tokens to ensure only the most recent request is valid.

WHERE email verification is required, THE system SHALL clearly communicate the purpose and expiration to the user.

### Password Recovery Security
WHEN a user requests password recovery, THE system SHALL send a verification code to their registered email address only.

THE password reset token SHALL be single-use and expire after 15 minutes to prevent token interception attacks.

IF a user attempts multiple password recovery requests, THE system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent email flooding attacks.

THE password recovery process SHALL never reveal the existing password or allow password changes without proper verification.

## Security Risk Mitigation

### Common Threat Protection
THE system SHALL implement proper input validation to prevent XSS attacks through task content, though specific implementation is developer discretion.

WHERE user input is processed, THE system SHALL sanitize content to prevent injection attacks while preserving business functionality.

THE application SHALL set appropriate security headers to mitigate common web vulnerabilities, with technical implementation determined by development team.

IF suspicious activity patterns are detected (rapid task creation/deletion), THE system SHALL trigger security monitoring alerts.

### Security Monitoring and Response
THE system SHALL log security-relevant events (logins, password changes, account deletions) with sufficient detail for investigation.

WHERE repeated failed access attempts occur, THE system SHALL trigger automated security responses based on defined business thresholds.

THE security logs SHALL be protected from unauthorized access or modification to maintain their integrity for investigation purposes.

IF a potential security incident is detected, THE system SHALL support mechanisms for rapid investigation and response within business requirements.

## Business Continuity Planning

### Data Backup and Recovery
THE system SHALL implement regular data backups to prevent permanent data loss from system failures.

WHEN restoring from backups, THE system SHALL ensure data consistency and minimize user impact during recovery operations.

THE backup retention policy SHALL keep historical data for 30 days to support recovery from accidental data loss scenarios.

IF a data corruption event occurs, THE system SHALL support point-in-time recovery to the most recent consistent state before corruption.

### Incident Response Capability
THE system SHALL support mechanisms to quickly isolate and contain security incidents while preserving evidence for investigation.

WHEN a security vulnerability is discovered, THE remediation process SHALL prioritize fixing issues based on business impact assessment.

THE incident response plan SHALL include clear communication protocols for affected users when required by circumstances.

WHILE managing security incidents, THE system SHALL maintain business operations to the greatest extent possible without compromising security.
