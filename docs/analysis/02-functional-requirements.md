# Table of Contents - Todo List Application Requirements

## Document Overview

This document provides the complete table of contents for the todoList application requirements documentation. It serves as the central navigation point for all requirement documents, ensuring that developers and stakeholders can easily access the information they need to understand, build, and maintain the system.

The todoList application is designed with minimal functionality to focus on the core task management experience. This documentation set comprehensively outlines the business requirements, functional specifications, user roles, and usage scenarios without prescribing technical implementation details.

## Table of Contents

This documentation suite consists of the following interconnected documents:

1. [Service Overview and Business Justification](./01-service-overview.md)
   - Understanding the purpose and goals of the todoList application
   - Core features and target user analysis
   - Success metrics and business objectives

2. [Functional Requirements Specification](./02-functional-requirements.md)
   - Complete description of system functionality in EARS format
   - User interactions and system behaviors
   - Validation rules and acceptance criteria

3. [User Roles and Permission Structure](./03-user-roles.md)
   - Definition of all user roles in the system
   - Authentication and authorization requirements
   - Permission matrix for access control

4. [User Stories and Interaction Scenarios](./04-user-stories.md)
   - Realistic user personas and their goals
   - Step-by-step interaction scenarios
   - Alternative flows and edge cases

## Document Navigation Guide

### Getting Started

Developers should begin with the [Service Overview and Business Justification](./01-service-overview.md) document to understand the fundamental purpose of the application and the business problems it solves. This context is essential for making informed implementation decisions that align with the intended user experience.

After understanding the service overview, proceed to the [Functional Requirements Specification](./02-functional-requirements.md) for detailed requirements on system behavior. This document contains all functional requirements written in EARS format, providing specific, measurable, and unambiguous requirements for development.

### Understanding User Interactions

The [User Stories and Interaction Scenarios](./04-user-stories.md) document provides realistic examples of how users will interact with the system. These scenarios help developers understand the human context behind the requirements and anticipate edge cases that might not be evident from functional requirements alone.

### Implementing Authentication and Authorization

The [User Roles and Permission Structure](./03-user-roles.md) document details the authentication model, user roles, and permission matrix. When implementing user management and access control, refer to this document for complete requirements on user roles, JWT implementation, and access restrictions.

### Document Relationships

All documents are designed to work together:

- The service overview provides context for the functional requirements
- Functional requirements specify the detailed behavior mentioned in user stories
- User roles define the permissions that govern interactions in user stories
- User stories illustrate the real-world application of functional requirements

### Recommended Reading Order

For optimal understanding, we recommend the following reading sequence:

1. 01-service-overview.md (understand the "why")
2. 02-functional-requirements.md (learn the "what")
3. 03-user-roles.md (understand user permissions)
4. 04-user-stories.md (see the "how" in practice)

All documents assume knowledge from the previous documents in this sequence, creating a progressive learning path for developers.
