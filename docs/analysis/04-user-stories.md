# User Stories: Minimal Todo Application

## Primary User Personas

### Task-Oriented Individual
A busy professional who juggles multiple responsibilities and needs a simple tool to track daily to-dos without complexity. They value:
- Quick capture of tasks during busy work periods
- Clear visibility of what needs to be done today
- Minimal distractions from additional features
- Reliable access across devices

Key Scenario: "When I hear my manager assign a new task during a meeting, I need to capture it immediately without disrupting the conversation. Adding a new task should take no more than five seconds."

## Core Task Lifecycle Journey

### Task Creation Process
WHEN a user identifies a new task they need to accomplish, THE system SHALL provide a straightforward mechanism for capturing essential details with minimal effort.

1. User initiates task creation from the main application screen
2. System presents focused input field with clear placeholder text
3. User enters task title (required) and optional details
4. System validates input according to business rules
5. User confirms creation with single action
6. System adds task to appropriate list with visual confirmation

**Business Rules for Task Creation**:
- THE task title SHALL be required with minimum 3 characters
- THE task title SHALL support up to 100 characters of alphanumeric text
- IF a user attempts to create a task with empty title, THEN THE system SHALL display specific error message
- THE system SHALL allow immediate task creation without mandatory due dates
- WHERE a task has a due date, THE system SHALL visually indicate urgency based on proximity to deadline

### Task Completion Process
WHEN a user completes a task, THE system SHALL record this action while maintaining historical context for productivity tracking.

1. User identifies completed task in their list
2. User initiates completion through intuitive gesture
3. System visually confirms task completion
4. System updates task status and records completion timestamp
5. System optionally moves completed task to archive view

**Business Rules for Task Completion**:
- THE system SHALL update task status to 'completed' upon user confirmation
- THE completion timestamp SHALL be recorded automatically in Asia/Seoul timezone
- WHILE viewing completed tasks, THE system SHALL display completion date in user-friendly format
- THE system SHALL NOT allow modification of completed tasks to maintain historical accuracy
- WHEN sorting tasks, THE system SHALL prioritize incomplete tasks above completed ones

## Authentication Flow Scenarios

### New User Registration
WHEN a potential user accesses the Todo application for the first time, THE system SHALL guide them through a simple registration process that captures only essential information.

1. User selects 'Create Account' option from login screen
2. System presents minimal registration form with required fields
3. User enters email address and creates secure password
4. System validates input against business rules
5. User receives confirmation email with verification link
6. Upon verification, system creates account and transitions to task management

**Business Rules for Registration**: 
- THE email address SHALL be validated for proper format
- THE password SHALL require minimum 8 characters including letters and numbers
- IF email is already registered, THEN THE system SHALL display specific message
- THE registration process SHALL NOT include social media or third-party options (minimal scope)

### Returning User Login
WHEN a registered user attempts to access their task list, THE system SHALL authenticate their identity efficiently while maintaining security.

1. User enters registered email and password
2. System validates credentials against stored information
3. Upon verification, system establishes secure session
4. System redirects user to their current task view
5. System maintains session for business-relevant duration

**Business Rules for Login**:
- THE system SHALL respond to login attempts within 2 seconds
- IF credentials are invalid, THEN THE system SHALL provide generic error message
- THE failed attempt counter SHALL increment with each incorrect submission
- AFTER three failed attempts, THE system SHALL require brief cooldown period
- THE user session SHALL remain active for 30 days of inactivity before requiring re-authentication

## Task Management Interaction Patterns

### Daily Task Review
WHEN a user begins their day, THE system SHALL present their tasks organized by urgency and deadline to facilitate effective planning.

```mermaid
graph LR
  A["Start Application"] --> B{"Today's Date"}
  B -->| "Has Tasks" | C["Active Tasks View"]
  C --> D{"Urgency Check"}
  D -->| "Due Today" | E["Highlight Due Today"]
  D -->| "Past Due" | F["Priority Past Due"]
  D -->| "Future" | G["Standard Visibility"]
  C --> H{"Completion Status"}
  H -->| "All Complete" | I["Show Achievement Message"]
  H -->| "Incomplete" | C
```

**Business Flow Details**:
- THE system SHALL load user's task list within 3 seconds of login
- WHILE loading tasks, THE system SHALL display progress indicator
- THE active task list SHALL sort by due date proximity (nearest first)
- Tasks without due dates SHALL appear after dated tasks in creation order
- Past due tasks SHALL receive visual highlight indicating urgency

### Task Editing Process
WHEN a user needs to modify an existing task, THE system SHALL facilitate this change while maintaining data integrity.

1. User identifies task requiring modification
2. User initiates edit process through intuitive control
3. System presents current task details for editing
4. User makes changes to task properties
5. System validates updates against business rules
6. User confirms changes with single action
7. System saves updates and returns to task list

**Business Rules for Editing**:
- THE system SHALL allow modification of title, description, and due date
- THE original creation timestamp SHALL remain immutable as business record
- IF changes violate business rules, THEN THE system SHALL specify exact issue
- WHILE editing, THE system SHALL preserve unsaved changes during brief interruptions
- WHERE a task becomes past due during editing, THE system SHALL update visual status

## Error Recovery Scenarios

### Input Validation Failures
WHEN a user provides invalid input during task creation or editing, THE system SHALL guide them toward successful completion through clear recovery pathways.

**Business Rules for Validation**:
- IF task title exceeds character limit, THEN THE system SHALL truncate visually while informing user
- WHEN entering invalid date format, THE system SHALL provide example of acceptable format
- THE system SHALL highlight exact field causing validation failure
- WHILE user is correcting errors, THE system SHALL preserve other entered data
- AFTER correction, THE system SHALL automatically revalidate without requiring restart

### System Interruption Recovery
WHEN unexpected interruptions occur during task management, THE system SHALL minimize disruption and data loss.

**Business Rules for Interruptions**:
- IF network connectivity is lost, THEN THE system SHALL cache user actions locally
- THE system SHALL automatically retry failed operations when connectivity resumes
- WHILE connection is restored, THE system SHALL synchronize pending changes
- IF conflicting changes occur during synchronization, THE system SHALL seek user resolution
- AFTER successful recovery, THE system SHALL confirm data integrity to user

## Edge Case Handling

### Duplicate Task Entries
WHEN a user attempts to create multiple tasks with identical titles, THE system SHALL accommodate this business reality while maintaining data clarity.

- THE system SHALL allow duplicate task titles (business reality: users may have multiple tasks for similar items)
- WHILE displaying duplicate tasks, THE system SHALL provide additional context for differentiation
- THE search function SHALL return all matching tasks when querying by title
- WHEN sorting, THE system SHALL use creation time to order identical titles
- THE system SHALL NOT require unique titles as this would conflict with genuine user scenarios

### Past Due Task Management
WHEN tasks remain incomplete beyond their intended deadline, THE system SHALL support user recovery without judgment.

- THE system SHALL visually differentiate past due tasks through color coding
- WHILE viewing past due tasks, THE system SHALL display elapsed time since deadline
- THE user SHALL be able to reset due date to today or future date
- THE system SHALL NOT automatically complete past due tasks (requiring user action)
- IF past due tasks accumulate, THE system SHALL suggest weekly review without judgment
