# Requirements Analysis Report: Error Handling for minimalTodo Application

## Introduction

The minimalTodo application requires comprehensive error handling to ensure a positive user experience while maintaining the principle of minimal functionality. This document specifies all error conditions, user recovery processes, and business requirements for error handling from a user perspective, without prescribing technical implementation details.

## Core Error Categories

The error handling system must address two primary categories of errors:

1. **User Input Errors**: Issues arising from invalid or incomplete user input
2. **System Errors**: Problems occurring during system processing or data operations

## Input Validation Failures

### Task Title Validation
WHEN a user attempts to create or update a task without providing a title, THE system SHALL prevent the action and display an appropriate error message indicating that a task title is required.

WHEN a user enters a task title that exceeds 200 characters, THE system SHALL prevent the action and display an error message indicating the maximum character limit.

### Data Format Validation
WHEN a user provides invalid data format for any task field, THE system SHALL prevent the submission and display an error message specifying the correct format requirements.

## System Error Conditions

### Authentication Failures
WHEN a user attempts to access the application with invalid credentials, THE system SHALL deny access and display a message prompting the user to check their login information.

WHEN a user's session expires due to inactivity, THE system SHALL redirect to the login page and display a message indicating that the session has ended.

### Data Operation Failures
WHEN a task creation, update, or deletion operation fails due to system issues, THE system SHALL preserve the user's input data and display a message indicating a temporary problem while suggesting retrying the action.

WHEN the system cannot retrieve a user's task list due to connectivity or server issues, THE system SHALL display a message explaining the temporary nature of the problem and suggest checking the connection and trying again later.

## User Recovery Processes

### Retry Mechanisms
WHERE system operation failures occur, THE system SHALL provide users with the ability to retry the failed action after acknowledging the error message.

### Data Preservation
WHILE a user is experiencing system errors during task creation or editing, THE system SHALL preserve any entered data to prevent loss when the user attempts to recover from the error.

### Navigation Recovery
IF a user loses their session due to timeout or other authentication issues, THEN THE system SHALL redirect to the login page and, upon successful re-authentication, return the user to their previous location in the application when possible.

## Error Messaging Guidelines

### Clarity and Specificity
THE error messages SHALL use clear, non-technical language that explains what went wrong in terms the user can understand.

THE error messages SHALL provide specific information about what action the user should take to resolve the issue when such action is within the user's control.

### Constructive Guidance
WHEN displaying error messages for input validation, THE system SHALL include guidance on the correct format or acceptable values rather than just stating that an error occurred.

### Consistent Presentation
THE system SHALL present all error messages in a consistent visual format that clearly distinguishes them from other application messages.

## Business Impact of Failures

### User Trust
IF users frequently encounter system errors without clear recovery paths, THEN THE system SHALL risk diminishing user trust in the application's reliability.

### User Retention
WHERE the application fails to handle errors gracefully, THE system SHALL increase the likelihood of user abandonment, particularly for a minimal application where user expectations for simplicity and reliability are high.

### Brand Reputation
WHILE handling a high volume of tasks, THE system SHALL maintain consistent error handling to protect the brand reputation for delivering a reliable minimal solution.

## Prevention Strategies

### Proactive Validation
THE system SHALL validate user input as early as possible in the process to prevent errors before they occur.

### System Monitoring
THE system SHALL monitor for recurring error patterns and provide administrative alerts when error rates exceed acceptable thresholds.

### User Education
THE system SHALL provide subtle guidance and examples within the user interface to prevent common input errors before they occur.

## Conclusion

This error handling requirements document specifies all business rules and user experience requirements for handling errors in the minimalTodo application. The implementation details, including specific error codes, API responses, and technical exception handling, are left to the discretion of the development team to ensure appropriate technical solutions while meeting these business requirements.
