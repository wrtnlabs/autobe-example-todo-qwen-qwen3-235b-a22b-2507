   * of capturing tasks during meetings or other time-sensitive situations where

   * the database's CASCADE constraint to automatically clean up dependent data
   * and maintain referential integrity. The task and its associated dependent
   * records are completely removed from both user access and system storage.

   * Security considerations include user data isolation to ensure users can

   * deleted tasks, consistent with the minimal implementation philosophy, so

   * defined in the Prisma schema (@relation(onDelete: Cascade)), which
   * automatically handles cleanup of related records to preserve data
   * integrity. While backup systems may retain the data for disaster recovery
