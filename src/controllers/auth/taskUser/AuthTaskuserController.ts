   * Creates a new user account for task management in the minimalTodo
   * application.
   *
   * This endpoint creates a new user account for the minimalTodo application,
   * enabling users to access their personal task management system.
   *
   * The operation initiates the user journey by collecting essential identity
   * information, specifically email and password, which map directly to the
   * `email` and `password_hash` fields in the `minimal_todo_taskusers` table.
   * During account creation, the system verifies email uniqueness against
   * existing records before proceeding, ensuring each user has a distinct
   * identity within the system. The password is securely hashed using
   * industry-standard algorithms before storage in the `password_hash` column,
   * never stored in plaintext.
   *
   * Upon successful registration, the system automatically authenticates the
   * user and establishes a session for immediate access to task management
   * functionality. The user's `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps are
   * recorded in Asia/Seoul timezone, reflecting the core business operating
   * region. No other profile information is collected to maintain the minimal
   * feature set philosophy.
   *
   * Security considerations include strict email validation to prevent invalid
   * addresses, password complexity requirements (minimum 8 characters with
   * letters and numbers), and protection against automated account creation
   * attempts through rate limiting. All operations maintain isolation between
   * user accounts, ensuring no cross-user data access.
   *
   * Related operations include the login operation for subsequent access, the
   * refresh operation for maintaining session validity, and the password reset
   * functionality for account recovery. This join operation serves as the entry
   * point to the complete authentication workflow, enabling all subsequent task
   * management activities.

  /**
   * Authenticates users with email and password for the minimalTodo
   * application.
   *
   * This endpoint authenticates existing users by verifying their email and
   * password credentials against stored records in the system.
   *
   * The operation processes user-submitted credentials by first locating the
   * matching record in the `minimal_todo_taskusers` table using the provided
   * email. It then compares the submitted password with the stored
   * `password_hash` using secure cryptographic verification. During
   * authentication, the system validates that the account is active (where
   * `deleted_at` is null) before granting access, enforcing account status
   * management according to business rules.
   *
   * Upon successful verification, the system creates a new session record in
   * the `minimal_todo_sessions` table, generating a cryptographically secure
   * token with appropriate expiration. The session includes the user's IP
   * address for security monitoring and establishes a 30-day validity period
   * before requiring re-authentication, balancing security with user
   * convenience as specified in business requirements.
   *
   * Security measures include protection against timing attacks through
   * consistent response times, rate limiting after multiple failed attempts,
   * and generic error messages that don't reveal whether the email or password
   * was incorrect. All password operations occur in memory without logging to
   * maintain security standards. Session tokens are transmitted securely and
   * stored with appropriate HTTP security flags.
   *
   * Related operations include the join operation for new users, the refresh
   * operation for maintaining active sessions, and the password reset flows for
   * account recovery. This login operation forms the central authentication
   * point for all returning users, enabling secure access to personal task
   * management functionality while maintaining the minimal security profile
   * appropriate for the application's scope.

  /**
   * Refreshes authentication tokens using a valid refresh token.
   *
   * This endpoint validates refresh tokens and issues new access tokens to
   * maintain user sessions without requiring re-authentication with primary
   * credentials.
   *
   * The operation processes refresh tokens by locating the corresponding
   * session record in the `minimal_todo_sessions` table, verifying that the
   * token exists and hasn't expired (checking against the `expires_at`
   * timestamp). During token validation, the system compares the current
   * Asia/Seoul time against the stored expiration to determine token validity,
   * ensuring session security while providing convenience for active users.
   *
   * Upon successful validation, the system generates new authentication tokens
   * and updates the session's expiration time while preserving the associated
   * user identity. The session's `created_at` timestamp remains unchanged as it
   * represents the original authentication event, while security monitoring
   * tracks refresh activity through the session records.
   *
   * Security considerations include single-use tokens for enhanced security,
   * binding tokens to the originating IP address for fraud detection, and
   * strict expiration policies that limit token lifespan. The refresh mechanism
   * operates independently from primary authentication to minimize exposure of
   * user credentials while maintaining session continuity.
   *
   * Related operations include the login operation that creates the initial
   * session, and the password reset flows that invalidate existing sessions.
   * This refresh operation supports the business requirement for maintaining
   * active user sessions for 30 days of inactivity, enhancing user experience
   * while adhering to appropriate security standards for the minimalTodo
