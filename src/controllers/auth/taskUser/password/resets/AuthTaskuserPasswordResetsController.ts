   * Requests password reset by email for account recovery.
   *
   * This endpoint initiates the password recovery process by creating and
   * delivering a secure reset token to the user's registered email address.
   *
   * The operation processes email submissions by first verifying the email
   * exists in the `minimal_todo_taskusers` table. Upon confirmation, it creates
   * a new record in the `minimal_todo_password_resets` table containing a
   * cryptographically secure token with a 15-minute expiration (recorded in
   * `expires_at`). The token is single-use by design, enforced through the
   * unique constraint on `minimal_todo_taskuser_id` in the password resets
   * table.
   *
   * The system delivers the reset token to the user's verified email address,
   * providing clear instructions with expiration details. The reset process
   * maintains security by not revealing whether an email exists in the system,
   * protecting against user enumeration attacks. All password reset operations
   * occur in Asia/Seoul timezone for consistent time-based validation.
   *
   * Technical implementation follows security best practices including token
   * randomness, short expiration windows, and automatic cleanup of expired
   * tokens. The design intentionally avoids security questions or additional
   * personal information requirements to maintain the minimal feature set while
   * ensuring security.
   *
   * Related operations include the password reset completion flow that
   * validates tokens and updates credentials. This reset request operation
   * fulfills the business requirement for secure account recovery while
   * maintaining the application's minimalist philosophy, providing users a
   * reliable path to regain access without compromising security standards.

  /**
   * Completes password reset using validation token.
   *
   * This endpoint completes the password recovery process by validating a reset
   * token and updating the user's password credentials.
   *
   * The operation processes token validation by locating the corresponding
   * record in the `minimal_todo_password_resets` table using the provided token
   * path parameter. It verifies the token hasn't expired by comparing current
   * Asia/Seoul time against the `expires_at` timestamp and ensures the token
   * hasn't been previously used through the unique constraint on
   * `minimal_todo_taskuser_id`.
   *
   * Upon successful token validation, the system updates the associated user's
   * `password_hash` in the `minimal_todo_taskusers` table with the new securely
   * hashed password. The operation immediately invalidates all active sessions
   * for the user by removing related records from the `minimal_todo_sessions`
   * table, ensuring previous access is terminated as a security measure
   * following credential changes.
   *
   * Security considerations include single-use token enforcement, short
   * 15-minute validity window, password complexity validation matching
   * registration requirements, and automatic cleanup of the password reset
   * record after successful completion. The design intentionally avoids
   * revealing specific failure reasons to prevent information leakage.
   *
   * Related operations include the password reset request flow that initiates
   * the recovery process. This completion operation fulfills the business
   * requirement for secure password management while maintaining the minimal
   * feature set philosophy, ensuring users can recover account access without
   * compromising application security standards or introducing unnecessary
   * complexity.
