/**
 * Creates a new user account for task management in the minimalTodo
 * application.
 *
 * This endpoint creates a new user account for the minimalTodo application,
 * enabling users to access their personal task management system.
 *
 * The operation initiates the user journey by collecting essential identity
 * information, specifically email and password, which map directly to the
 * `email` and `password_hash` fields in the `minimal_todo_taskusers` table.
 * During account creation, the system verifies email uniqueness against
 * existing records before proceeding, ensuring each user has a distinct
 * identity within the system. The password is securely hashed using
 * industry-standard algorithms before storage in the `password_hash` column,
 * never stored in plaintext.
 *
 * Upon successful registration, the system automatically authenticates the user
 * and establishes a session for immediate access to task management
 * functionality. The user's `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps are
 * recorded in Asia/Seoul timezone, reflecting the core business operating
 * region. No other profile information is collected to maintain the minimal
 * feature set philosophy.
 *
 * Security considerations include strict email validation to prevent invalid
 * addresses, password complexity requirements (minimum 8 characters with
 * letters and numbers), and protection against automated account creation
 * attempts through rate limiting. All operations maintain isolation between
 * user accounts, ensuring no cross-user data access.
 *
 * Related operations include the login operation for subsequent access, the
 * refresh operation for maintaining session validity, and the password reset
 * functionality for account recovery. This join operation serves as the entry
 * point to the complete authentication workflow, enabling all subsequent task
 * management activities.

/**
 * Authenticates users with email and password for the minimalTodo application.
 *
 * This endpoint authenticates existing users by verifying their email and

 *
 * The operation processes user-submitted credentials by first locating the
 * matching record in the `minimal_todo_taskusers` table using the provided
 * email. It then compares the submitted password with the stored
 * `password_hash` using secure cryptographic verification. During
 * authentication, the system validates that the account is active (where
 * `deleted_at` is null) before granting access, enforcing account status
 * management according to business rules.
 *
 * Upon successful verification, the system creates a new session record in the
 * `minimal_todo_sessions` table, generating a cryptographically secure token
 * with appropriate expiration. The session includes the user's IP address for
 * security monitoring and establishes a 30-day validity period before requiring
 * re-authentication, balancing security with user convenience as specified in
 * business requirements.
 *
 * Security measures include protection against timing attacks through
 * consistent response times, rate limiting after multiple failed attempts, and
 * generic error messages that don't reveal whether the email or password was
 * incorrect. All password operations occur in memory without logging to
 * maintain security standards. Session tokens are transmitted securely and
 * stored with appropriate HTTP security flags.
 *
 * Related operations include the join operation for new users, the refresh
 * operation for maintaining active sessions, and the password reset flows for
 * account recovery. This login operation forms the central authentication point
 * for all returning users, enabling secure access to personal task management
 * functionality while maintaining the minimal security profile appropriate for

/**
 * Refreshes authentication tokens using a valid refresh token.
 *
 * This endpoint validates refresh tokens and issues new access tokens to
 * maintain user sessions without requiring re-authentication with primary
 * credentials.
 *
 * The operation processes refresh tokens by locating the corresponding session
 * record in the `minimal_todo_sessions` table, verifying that the token exists
 * and hasn't expired (checking against the `expires_at` timestamp). During
 * token validation, the system compares the current Asia/Seoul time against the
 * stored expiration to determine token validity, ensuring session security
 * while providing convenience for active users.
 *
 * Upon successful validation, the system generates new authentication tokens
 * and updates the session's expiration time while preserving the associated
 * user identity. The session's `created_at` timestamp remains unchanged as it
 * represents the original authentication event, while security monitoring
 * tracks refresh activity through the session records.
 *
 * Security considerations include single-use tokens for enhanced security,
 * binding tokens to the originating IP address for fraud detection, and strict
 * expiration policies that limit token lifespan. The refresh mechanism operates
 * independently from primary authentication to minimize exposure of user
 * credentials while maintaining session continuity.
 *
 * Related operations include the login operation that creates the initial
 * session, and the password reset flows that invalidate existing sessions. This
 * refresh operation supports the business requirement for maintaining active
 * user sessions for 30 days of inactivity, enhancing user experience while
 * adhering to appropriate security standards for the minimalTodo application's
