  /**
   * Paginated response container for task search results.
   *
   * This container type defines the structure of the response for the search
   * operation, wrapping the actual task data with pagination metadata. It
   * follows the standard IPage<T> interface pattern but is specialized for
   * holding IMinimalTodoTask.ISummary items.
   *
   * The container includes a pagination object that provides metadata about
   * the current page, including the current page number, limit (items per
   * page), total number of records, and total number of pages. This enables
   * clients to render appropriate pagination controls and inform users about
   * the scope of available data.
   *
   * The data field contains an array of IMinimalTodoTask.ISummary objects,
   * representing the tasks that match the search criteria for the current
   * page. This summary view includes only essential fields to minimize data
   * transfer and improve rendering performance, particularly important when
   * displaying large numbers of tasks.
   *
   * The container may also include a search field that echoes back the search
   * term used in the request, allowing clients to confirm what query produced
   * the results. This supports user experience by providing feedback about
   * the current filter state and enabling easy modification of search
   * criteria.
   *
   * By defining this as a named type in the components schema, the system
   * ensures consistency in paginated responses across different operations
   * and client implementations. This promotes reliable integration and
   * enhances developer experience by providing a clear contract for how
   * paginated data is structured.
   *
   * The implementation follows REST API best practices for pagination,
   * providing both the data and the metadata needed to navigate through large
   * result sets efficiently. This supports the business requirement for
   * responsive data retrieval, ensuring that task lists load completely
   * within 3 seconds even with a substantial number of active tasks.
   *
   * The fixed structure of the container (required pagination and data
   * fields) ensures predictable responses that clients can reliably parse and
   * render. This reduces integration complexity and minimizes the potential
   * for errors in client-side code that processes paginated results.
   *

    /**
     * Pagination metadata for task search results.
     *
     * This field contains information about the current page in the result
     * set, including the current page number, the number of items per page
     * (limit), the total number of records matching the search criteria,
     * and the total number of pages available. This metadata enables
     * clients to render appropriate pagination controls and inform users
     * about the scope of available data.
     *
     * The current property indicates the zero-based index of the current
     * page, typically ranging from 0 to pages-1. The limit property
     * specifies how many items are included in the current page, with a
     * default value of 100 that balances data transfer efficiency with the
     * need to minimize round trips to the server.
     *
     * The records property indicates the total number of tasks that match
     * the search criteria, regardless of pagination. This allows clients to
     * calculate the total number of pages and provide users with context
     * about the size of their task collection. The pages property provides
     * the total number of pages available, calculated as the ceiling of
     * records divided by limit.
     *
     * This metadata is generated server-side based on the requested
     * pagination parameters and the total count of matching records. It
     * ensures that clients have accurate information about the result set,
     * preventing inconsistencies between displayed data and pagination
     * controls.
     *
     * The inclusion of complete pagination metadata supports various client
     * implementations, from simple next/previous controls to comprehensive
     * page number navigation. It also enables features like "load more"
     * infinite scrolling by providing the total count needed to determine
     * when all data has been loaded.

    /**
     * Array of task summaries matching the search criteria.
     *
     * This field contains the actual task data for the current page of
     * results, with each item represented as an IMinimalTodoTask.ISummary
     * object. The array includes only tasks that match the search criteria
     * and fall within the requested page range, providing focused results
     * that match the user's query.
     *
     * The items in the array include essential task information: the unique
     * identifier (id), title (content), status (completion state), and
     * creation timestamp (created_at). This minimal field set reduces
     * bandwidth usage and improves rendering performance while providing
     * sufficient information for users to identify and assess tasks in list
     * views.
     *
     * The array is ordered according to business rules, typically with
     * incomplete tasks prioritized above completed ones and sorted by
     * creation date (newest first) within each status group. This ordering
     * supports common workflow patterns where users want to focus on
     * pending work and see their most recent additions at the top of the
     * list.
     *
     * The size of the array is controlled by the limit parameter in the
     * request, with a default of 100 items per page. This balances the
     * amount of data transferred per request with the need to minimize
     * round trips to the server, optimizing performance for both fast
     * connections and mobile networks.
     *
     * The array is empty when no tasks match the search criteria, with the
     * pagination metadata reflecting the total count (typically 0 for
     * records and pages). This allows clients to handle empty results
     * gracefully and provide appropriate feedback to users.
