   * The access token is a cryptographically secure JWT (JSON Web Token) used
   * to authenticate requests to protected endpoints in the minimalTodo
   * application. After successful authentication or token refresh, clients
   * must include this token in the Authorization header using the Bearer
   * scheme for all subsequent requests to protected resources.
   *
   * The token contains encoded claims about the user's identity, scope of
   * access, and expiration time. It follows industry standard JWT format with
   * header, payload, and signature components. The payload includes the
   * user's ID, role, and other authentication context information needed for
   * authorization decisions.
   *
   * Security requirements include transmitting tokens exclusively over HTTPS
   * to prevent interception, storing tokens securely on client devices (using
   * secure storage mechanisms), and implementing proper token revocation
   * procedures. The system validates tokens on every request to protected
   * endpoints, verifying the signature, expiration time, and other claims
   * before granting access to resources.
   *
   * Token expiration is managed according to business requirements, with
   * access tokens having a limited lifespan that requires periodic renewal
   * through the refresh token mechanism. This approach enhances security by
   * minimizing the window of opportunity for token misuse while maintaining
   * user session continuity.
   *
   * Token generation follows cryptographic best practices with sufficient
   * entropy to prevent guessing attacks. The signing algorithm uses
   * industry-standard cryptographic methods (e.g., HS256, RS256) appropriate
   * for the application's security requirements and deployment environment.
   *
   * Related operations include the authentication endpoints that issue
   * tokens, the refresh process that extends session validity, and the
   * authorization middleware that validates tokens on protected routes. The
   * complete token lifecycle is managed to balance security and usability for
   * the minimalTodo application's user base in the Asia/Seoul timezone
   * context.

   * > This property directly implements the token issuance requirement
   * > specified in authentication operations but not explicitly defined in the
   * > Prisma schema as it represents a standard authentication component.
