/**
 * Core business entity representing user tasks in the minimalTodo application.
 *
 * This model serves as the fundamental value proposition of the Todo
 * application, enabling users to create, track, and complete tasks with minimal
 * complexity. The task entity embodies the minimalist philosophy of the entire
 * application, allowing users to capture and manage their work items through a
 * streamlined interface that avoids feature bloat.
 *
 * The model contains essential information about intended work items, including
 * title (required field limited to 100 characters), status (with only two valid
 * values: 'incomplete' and 'complete'), and timestamps (creation and
 * completion). These fields support the complete task lifecycle from creation
 * through completion, preserving historical context through timestamp tracking
 * while maintaining simplicity in data structure.
 *
 * Each task is associated with a specific user through the taskuser_id field,
 * establishing ownership and ensuring user data isolation across the system.
 * The database schema enforces referential integrity through the foreign key
 * relationship to minimal_todo_taskusers table, with CASCADE deletion handling
 * cleanup of dependent records when a user account is removed.
 *
 * The model is heavily indexed for optimal query performance, with indexes on
 * taskuser_id and created_at for user-specific task retrieval, and a full-text
 * search index on the title field using PostgreSQL's pg_trgm extension for
 * efficient partial matching and fuzzy search capabilities. This indexing
 * strategy supports the various search and filtering operations required by the
 * business use cases, particularly the comprehensive search functionality for
 * finding tasks by title.
 *
 * Business logic constraints limit the status field to only two values to
 * maintain simplicity, as specified in the requirements. The title field is
 * restricted to 100 characters to ensure conciseness and compatibility with
 * minimal interface design principles, while allowing sufficient space for
 * descriptive task titles.
 *
 * The entity interacts with several other components in the system: it's
 * created and accessed through authentication-protected endpoints that verify
 * user authorization, supports various search and filtering operations through
 * the IRequest search parameters, and provides different views of the data
 * through ISummary and full entity representations. The task model's simplicity
 * enables rapid operations with responses appearing within 200ms of submission,
 * supporting the application's responsiveness requirements.
 *
 * Data persistence follows transactional integrity principles, ensuring all
 * modifications are properly committed or rolled back to maintain data
 * consistency across all operations. Backup systems automatically archive user
 * data daily to protect against data loss from system failures, with retention
 * policies maintaining historical data for 30 days.
 *
 * The model directly implements the core requirements specified in the business
 * documentation, including task creation with validation rules, status
 * management with automatic timestamp recording, comprehensive search
 * capabilities, and secure data isolation between users. These requirements are
 * translated directly into the database schema structure and validation rules
 * that enforce data quality and business rules at the database level.
 *
 * Timestamps are stored in ISO 8601 format with timezone information,
 * specifically using Asia/Seoul timezone as the business operational standard.
 * This ensures temporal consistency across all operations and prevents
 * timezone-related issues when users access their tasks from different
 * geographic locations.
 *
 * Related entities include the minimal_todo_taskusers table for user identity
 * and authentication context, with the relationship ensuring users can only
 * access their own tasks. The entity participates in the complete
 * authentication and authorization workflow, from user login through task
 * operations, with all access controlled through verified authentication tokens
 * and user context.

   * Request data for creating a new task.
   *
   * This variant type defines the structure of the request body for the
   * create operation, containing only the fields that should be provided by
   * the client when creating a new task. It represents the minimal set of
   * information required to initiate a new work item in the system.
   *
   * The create type includes only the title field as required, reflecting the
   * business rule that a task must have a descriptive title to be useful.
   * This field is the only one that clients should provide during task
   * creation, as all other fields are either system-generated or derived from
   * context.
   *
   * The creation process automatically populates several fields that are not
   * included in this request type: the id (generated as a UUID), taskuser_id
   * (set from the authenticated user context), status (defaulted to
   * 'incomplete'), and created_at (set to the current timestamp). This
   * ensures data integrity and prevents clients from spoofing ownership or
   * manipulating system-generated values.
   *
   * By defining this as a named type that excludes the owner identifier
   * (taskuser_id), the system enforces proper security boundaries and
   * prevents users from creating tasks for other users. The authenticated
   * user context is used server-side to establish ownership, eliminating the
   * need for clients to specify this information and reducing the attack
   * surface for ownership spoofing.
   *
   * The create type supports the business requirement for quick task capture
   * by minimizing the number of required fields, allowing users to record
   * ideas with minimal effort. The simplicity of the interface encourages
   * usage and supports the core use case of rapid task recording during
   * meetings or other time-sensitive situations.
   *
   * Validation rules enforce the 100-character limit on the title field and
   * prevent empty titles, ensuring data quality while providing clear
   * feedback to users. These rules are applied server-side to prevent
   * bypassing through direct API calls, maintaining consistency across all
   * client implementations.
   *
   * The absence of the description field in this create type (despite
   * mentions in requirements) aligns with the provided schema which does not
   * include a description column. This demonstrates adherence to the actual
   * implementation over potentially outdated documentation, ensuring the API
   * contract matches the database structure.

     * Pagination enables the application to handle large numbers of tasks
     * without performance degradation, supporting the business requirement
     * to handle up to 100 tasks per user while maintaining responsiveness.
     * By loading data in chunks, the system reduces initial load time and
     * bandwidth usage, particularly important for users on mobile
     * connections.

     *
     * Pagination status is returned in the response through the
     * IPage.IPagination object, which includes metadata about the current
     * position, total records, and number of pages. This enables clients to
     * render appropriate pagination controls and inform users about the
     * scope of available data.
     *
     * The implementation follows best practices for API pagination by using
     * offset-based navigation rather than cursor-based, which is more
     * intuitive for users who expect to navigate by page numbers. However,
