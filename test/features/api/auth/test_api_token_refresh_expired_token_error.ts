/**
 * Test token refresh failure due to expired refresh token.
 *
 * This test validates the system's security policy for handling expired
 * refresh tokens. It ensures that when a refresh token's validity period
 * has expired (determined by comparing the current Asia/Seoul time with the
 * expires_at timestamp in the minimal_todo_sessions table), the system
 * properly rejects refresh attempts and requires users to re-authenticate
 * with their primary credentials.
 *
 * The test follows a complete user journey:
 *
 * 1. Create a new user account and establish initial authentication
 * 2. Extract the refresh token from the authentication response
 * 3. Simulate time progression to exceed the token's expiration
 * 4. Attempt to refresh authentication with the expired token
 * 5. Verify the refresh attempt fails with appropriate error
 * 6. Confirm the security policy of limited token lifespan is enforced
 *
 * This test is critical for maintaining the application's security posture
 * by preventing unauthorized access through expired tokens while providing
 * a clear path for legitimate users to re-establish their sessions.
